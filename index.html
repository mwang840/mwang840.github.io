        <h2 class="description">
            I'm currently finishing my senior year at the University of Delaware. At my school I have taken or currently taking relevant coursework such as Computer Visions, Advanced Web Technologies, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Database Systems and Educational Game Development. Over the time spent as a computer scientist, I have picked up many languages and concepts whether on my own, through school or during my work experience.

I've made projects such as building a front-end computer science course scheduler for one of my courses to government contracting work during an internship over the summer with Northrop Grumman. The resume link describes more of my experiences but I'm willing to explore my passion for creating software regardless of language or concept!</td>

Now with pythons data analysis packages and courses I&apos;ve taken at UD such as Data Mining, Machine Learning, Computer Visions, I&apos;m looking forward to a career in AI/Data Analyst.</td>
