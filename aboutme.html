    <h2>Here are some of the stuff I like to do in my free time! ⌚</h2>

    <ul>
        <p>Chess: I have been playing the sport since elementary school and progressively getting better at the sport♔</p>
        <p>Soccer: I like the team Tottenham, don&apos;t roast me for my team selection (my team has not won a trophy in 30 years) ⚽.</p>
        <p>Traveling: The world is big, so why not visit places throughout the world!</p>
