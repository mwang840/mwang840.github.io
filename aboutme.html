        <p>I like web development and I&apos;ve been working with a lot of frontend code such as React, Next and Html/Css/JavaScript and I am looking forward for learning more with this class, specifically the back-end and database side of coding 🌐.</p>

        <li><p>Aviation: I have gotten into aviation since I have started traveling. I like the Boeing 777 one of my favorite aircraft types and I hope to fly on the Airbus A-380 in the future (I like Etihad since the logo is amazing for me 🇦🇪) 🛧!</p></li>
